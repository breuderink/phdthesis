\chapter{Influence of loss of control}
\label{chap:loc}

\lettrine{I}{t} is widely believed that \ac{BCI} performance fluctuates over
time due to non-stationary feature distributions \cite{mueller2008mlr,
blankertz2007ics, bunau2009ssa, vidal1977rtd, shenoy2006tac, krauledat2008tzt,
sun2006afe, wolpaw2002bci, jatzev2008ecn}. These non-stationary feature
distributions violate the basic assumption made by the classification models
that the evaluation data (i.e. the online session) is distributed identically
to the data the model was trained on. This problem is known as \emph{covariate shift}, and leads to decreases in the classification performance.
%
Among the hypothesised causes for these non-stationary feature distributions
are changes in the mental state (e.g. fatigue, workload, \ac{LOC}) and
artifacts \cite{blankertz2007ics, jatzev2008ecn}.

%
Although it seems plausible that mental state changes that are detectable in
the \ac{EEG} can interfere with \ac{BCI} operation, there is not much
experimental evidence for this effect. 

In this Chapter, we therefore describe an experiment\footnote{ The work
described in chapter was accepted for publication in the journal IEEE
Transactions of Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering
\cite{reuderink2011ilc}.} we performed to investigate the influence of a
feeling of \ac{LOC} on the detectability of movements with the left and right
index finger through the \ac{EEG}. 
%
Changes in the \ac{EEG} related to users experiencing a state of \ac{LOC} might
lead to a decrease in \ac{BCI} performance due to the aforementioned covariate
shift. In turn, the user state is again influenced by the decreased performance
of the \ac{BCI}; for example, the non-working \ac{BCI} could cause increased
frustration, anger and reduced alertness. This interaction between the user
state and the \ac{BCI} performance might result in a positive feedback loop,
leading to a \ac{BCI} that spins out of control.
%
Given the huge drawbacks of a \ac{BCI} that can stop working depending on the
mental state of a user, understanding the influence of changes in the mental
state on the \ac{BCI} is of great importance to develop reliable \acp{BCI}.

In the following sections we will describe previous work on the relation between
mental states and \ac{BCI} performance, the methods we used, our results, and a
discussion of our experiment, followed by conclusions and directions for future
research.
