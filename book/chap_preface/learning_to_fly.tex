\begin{verse} \it
Into the distance, a ribbon of black\\
Stretched to the point of no turning back\\
A flight of fancy on a windswept field\\
Standing alone my senses reeled\\
A fatal attraction is holding me fast,\\
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies\\
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings\\
Unheeded warnings, I thought, I thought of everything\\
No navigator to find my way home\\
Unladened, empty and turned to stone\\
A soul in tension --- that's learning to fly\\
Condition grounded but determined to try

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies\\
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,\\
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air,\\
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly\\
Out of the corner of my watering eye\\
A dream unthreatened by the morning light\\
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this\\
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

Can't keep my mind from the circling skies\\
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I \\
